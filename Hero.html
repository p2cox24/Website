<font size="5"><p><b>Nyjah Huston was born in Davis California on November 30th, 1994. He has three brothers and 
one sister. Him and his family were vegans and they were homeschooled. His father was a skateboarder
and he forced Nyjah to skateboard every day while he was only five years old. His father decided to
 suddenly move to Puerto Rico which caused problems with Nyjah and his sponsor. While in Puerto Rico
  his parents split up and him and his father stayed in Puerto Rico but his mom and sisters went back
   to California. Nyjah eventually was able to move back in with his mother and sisters. 

<p>Nyjahs first sponsor <a href="https://www.elementbrand.com/">  Element Skateboards  </a> had Nyjah appear
 in many video productions and he participated in many popular contests, such as the Dew tour and the 
 Vans Downtown Showdown. In 2008 Nyjah left <a href="https://www.elementbrand.com/">Element Skateboards</a> 
 then in 2009 Nyjah would launch his own skateboard deck company called I&I. His skateboard deck company 
 would not last long when it stopped operating only two years after launching. After I&I stopped operating
 Nyjah then went back to <a href="https://www.elementbrand.com/">Element Skateboards</a>. During this time
  he also joined the DC shoe companys team.</b>
